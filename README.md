# Hackthon_2025_JalDrishti
This is our project which we developed in AICTE SIH 2024 finals where we are assessing reservoir storage capacities by forecasting future water requirements by training a Machine Learning model based upon historical data such as population, rainfall, temperature etc. Here we are using historical data of population, rainfall, temperature as well as water usage data to predict future water requirements using LSTM model. We are also assessing the storage capacities of reservoirs and checking if they can meet the water demand of the increasing population. This problem statement was published by Ministry Of jal shakti (SIH 1692). This is the prototype that we showcased in the Grand Finale of AICTE SIH 2024.
